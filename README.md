# Python Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Python projects repository:)

This repository is a curated collection of Python projects I have worked on through my studies at Portland State University, as well as independent, creative projects I am personally passionate about. It serves as both a learning archive and a professional portfolio showcasing my growth in data analysis, modeling, and problem solving.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document academic and personal Python work in one place
- Demonstrate applied data analysis and programming skills
- Show continuous learning and experimentation beyond coursework
- Provide transparent, reproducible examples of my work

## Project Sources

Projects in this repository come from two main sources:

### Portland State University
These projects were completed as part of coursework in data science, business analytics, economics, and quantitative analysis. They focus on:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Statistical modeling and regression
- Machine learning fundamentals
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Business and economic insights using data

### Personal & Creative Projects
These projects are self-driven and reflect topics I am genuinely interested in exploring. They may include:
- Real-world datasets
- Predictive modeling experiments
- Automation and scripting
- Exploratory research questions
- Visualization-driven analysis

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization
- Analytical thinking and problem framing
