# Python-Projects
The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can classify whether a patient has Parkinson's disease or not, using machine learning algorithms trained on relevant datasets. By analyzing and interpreting these biomedical markers, the model will help in early diagnosis and intervention, potentially improving patient outcomes.
